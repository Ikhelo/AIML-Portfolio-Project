        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset is a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in industries that employ the use of machines and equipment. Due to trade secrets issues, maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain. For this reason, the synthetic data was created for training purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset is from the UC Irvine repository and was donated on 29 August 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Composition\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset consists of 10,000 instances. Each instance contains readings, which are usually collected by sensors fitted on the machine parts. These readings are information that can signal the health status of the machines. The instances contain (1) product ID (L, M, H for Low, Medium and Low) for the quality of the product being machined, (2) air temperature [K], (3) process temperature [K], (4) rotational speed [rpm], calculated from a power of 2860W overlaid with normally distributed noise, (5) Torque [Nm]; normally distributed around 40Nm, (6) Tool wear [min]; the quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the processing tool, (7) Machine failure. The dataset consists of one-hot encoded failure modes corresponding to tool wear failure (TWF), heat dissipation failure (HDF), power failure (PWF), overstrain failure (OSF), and random failure (RNF).\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are 10,000 instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset is a synthetic dataset of predictive maintenance records. The dataset exhibits records of a multivariate time series. This dataset is not a subset of a larger dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each instance consists of numerical data for air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. The remaining entries of machine failure, tool wear failure, heat dissipation failure, power failure, overstrain failure, and random failures are all binary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Yes. There exist labels in the dataset. They represent when the machine fails or does not fail in a binary sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are no missing data. Data is complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are relationships between the instances of the output - machine failures and the failure modes descriptors. At least one of the failure modes must be true for machine failure to occur; hence, the label is set to 1. However, it is not transparent to the machine learning method which of the failure modes has caused the process of the machine to fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "- There is no recommended data split of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset is self-contained. It does not rely on any external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset is comprised of synthetic data. Although it is not real, it reflects the data collected from predictive maintenance records.\n",

        "- The dataset is synthetic and does not contain any confidential information. The dataset is not a subpopulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Data is a predictive maintenance dataset that does not relate to humans.\n",

        "- The data is not a subsample.\n",
        "- The data represents synthetic preventive maintenance data for the year 2020.\n",

        "- AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Data is synthetic data that reflects predictive maintenance in the industry. The air temperature and process temperature features have normalised to a standard deviation of 2K and around 300K, and a standard deviation of 1K added to the air temperature plus 10K. The machine failure consists of five independent failure modes: tool wear failure, heat dissipation failure, power failure, overstrain failure, and random failure. All the failure modes are one-hot encoded.\n",

        "- It's unknown to the author of this datasheet if there are links to any papers that have used this dataset, however, see below a link to the dataset: AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset - UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has over 17,000 views already.\n",

        "\n",
        "- AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Data is a synthetic dataset. Although it reflects the expectations of a real predictive maintenance dataset, it does not reveal any organisation's trade secrets.\n",

The binary output (Machine failures) is predicted using two models: an LSTM neural network and a decision tree model.\n",
