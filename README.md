# Predictive Maintenance

## Context
Machine failure is said to occur in equipment if the equipment underperforms partially or entirely or stops functioning the way it was designed to perform.
Machine failure impacts production work significantly. Machine failures can lead to unplanned downtime and repair costs, productivity losses, health and safety implications, and impact on the production and delivery of services. Its effect can have a lasting impact ultimately on the company's reputation. The cost of machine repairs is usually higher than it would have been had preventive maintenance been undertaken. Unplanned downtime can prevent the company from meeting its production demands to its clients and customers. A machine may not be able to perform its functions either fully or partially. Underperformance can create products that do not meet set quality criteria. Apart from the economic effects on the company's bottom line and reputation, machine failure can also have health and safety implications for the workers and expose the company to legal risks.
## Objective
- To identify the major causes of machine failures and prevent unplanned downtime, productivity losses, increased repair costs, impact on production and delivery of services, health and safety implications and company reputation.

- Develop a model that can predict machine failure to enable preventive and predictive maintenance.

- Preserve the equipment's service life and value during the equipment's design life.

- Provide insights to the company's maintenance department on the timely applications of maintenance measures to prevent downtimes, productivity losses, increased repair costs, and any adverse impact on production.
